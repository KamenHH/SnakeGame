# SnakeGame

This is a small course work of mine. A beginner's attempt at making a version of the classic snake type games, without using any graphic libraries or clearing the screen every 2 seconds. I am well aware of all the incredibly noobish mistakes which I have commited during the construction of this project and I'm open for all kinds of ideas for improvements! :))
PS: The project was created in Visual Studio 2017, using the programming language 'C'.
